# The hashmac program will compute a mac address for an interface the
# same way that systemd's networkd computes the MAC address so as to
# be completely compatible.  It is intended that this service runs in
# the cube-essential as that own the hardware initially, but it could
# run in the network prime as long as the systemd environment is passed
# down or set by a puppet file.

# This service can be enabled by adding the kernel command line arguments:
#     systemd.wants=rndmac.service systemd.setenv=rndmac=INTERFACE
# Where interace is the interface to be assigned a random static MAC address
# based on the /etc/machine-id file  Example for eth0:
#     systemd.wants=rndmac.service systemd.setenv=rndmac=eth0
