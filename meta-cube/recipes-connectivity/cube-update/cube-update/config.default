# Time in seconds between polls.
#     Note that there is no attempt to align this on a "natural" time
#     boundary, nor to account for load-based skew.  This is the time
#     between the end of a poll and the beginning of the next poll.
#     The default value is a little less than a week.  For many
#     environments, this should be reduced in order to pick up security
#     updates more promptly.

# Install updates automatically
#     Options are "true" or "false" (command to execute).
#     If true, the service automatically downloads and installs
#         all available updates.
#     If false, the service automatically checks for updates, but
#         does not install them without manual intervention.  The
#	  fact that updates are available is put in /etc/motd.
