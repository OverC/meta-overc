Subject: [PATCH] vim: Make text mode editing Great again.

Some of the default vim settings can be downright annoying, and are not
enabled on most standard distros out there.

The "bad" settings are"

	set mouse=a
		-breaks basic cut-and-paste

	set autoindent
		-breaks paste of a code block

	set backup
		-pollutes "git status" with lots of "~" files

	set incsearch
		-causes source window to twitch and flail while typing

I've added comments to clearly indicate this change does deviate from the
vim default, so offended people can direct their complaints accordingly.
