Overc: /usr/bin/overc

Introduction
==============================================================
This project provides atomic upgrades of the OverC host system.
The upgrades process uses the BtrFS's snapshot feature and the 
smartpm package management to make the upgrades process atomic 
and rollbackable.


Requirements of the system's deployment
==============================================================
In order to use this project to do atomic and rollbackable 
upgrades, the host system's installation should meet the following
special requirements:

1) The boot directory should be installed/mounted on a separate disk 
   partion. The UEFI or grub bootloader can be installed on this
   partion. This partion can be formated any filesystem which UEFI/grub
   supported.

2) The rootfs should be deployed in a BtrFS formatted disk/partion.
   In addition, it should not be located in the BtrFS's root tree,
   instead it should be in the root tree's subvolume named 'rootfs'.
   After installation, the subvolume of 'rootfs' should be set mounted 
   as default. The subvolume is identified by <id>, which is returned 
   by the subvolume list command. For how to set the default subvolume,
   please see https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Manpage/btrfs-subvolume.

3) In order to do the upgrades successfully, The BtrFS's quota should 
   be at least twice of the rootfs's size.

4) The bootloader(grub)'s boot menu should afford two boot entry:
   The default one should be for the normal boot, and the second one
   should be for the backup boot. The backup boot entry's kernel option
   should be as below:

   linux /bzImage_bakup rootflags=subvol=rootfs_bakup root=/dev/<sdX>

   The backup's kernel is named as 'bzImage_bakup' and the backup's rootfs
   is deployed in the subvolume of 'rootfs_bakup'.

Usage
==============================================================

1. To update packages lists:
----------------------------

$overc host update

This command will calling smartpm to do the rpm database's update.

If there are new packages available for upgrade, then you can run
to upgrade.

2. Upgrade the system:
--------------------------

$overc host upgrade 

This command will create a snapshot of the current running rootfs for
backup boot and then create another snapshot for upgrading. After the
upgrading successfully, it will set the upgraded snapshot subvolume as
the mounted default one. The next reboot will switch to the upgraded 
system.

In order to do system reboot after the upgrades, please append '-r' to
the upgrade command.

3. Rollback the system
-------------------------
After a system upgrades and reboot, if there is something wrong, the system
can be rollback to the previous system.

There are two way to rollback to the previous status: one is by selecting
the backup boot entry in the bootloader when do booting, and the other one
by running:

$overc host rollback -r

in the system.

Notes: it's not allowed to run rollback command just after run upgrades.
This will put the system into an unkwon status.
