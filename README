meta-overc/meta-cube
===================

The goal of these layers is to create a yocto build which can be deployed on a
modern server to provide a useable environment which in turn can build yocto
(and indeed the variant from this layer itself).  A lot of the heavy lifting
to achieve this has been done by the build-appliance image type of yocto, but
that is limited to virtual deployment, and does not have all the development
tools and/or man pages and things like tab completion that make a system
"useable".  This layer attempts to close that gap.

Both meta-overc, and meta-overc/meta-cube should be added to your bblayers
file.
